/**
 * Single source of truth for the npm caret ranges of `@nebutra/*` packages
 * that scaffolded / generated user projects depend on.
 *
 * This module is intentionally DEPENDENCY-FREE (no imports) so it can be
 * re-exported by the npm-published CLIs (`create-sailor`, `nebutra`) via
 * relative path (tsup inlines it with zero added runtime dependency) and
 * consumed by `apps/web` / `@nebutra/startup-os` without dragging in the rest
 * of `@nebutra/preset`'s graph.
 *
 * Source of truth for *numbers*: the `version` field of each declassified
 * (`private: false`) package.json in this monorepo. Keep this map equal to
 * `^${package.json.version}` for every listed package.
 *
 * Maintain with:
 *   pnpm package-versions:sync   # rewrite ranges from package.json
 *   pnpm package-versions:check  # fail CI / release on drift
 *
 * NEVER emit "workspace:*" into a user-facing project — that token only
 * resolves inside this monorepo and will break `pnpm install` for users.
 *
 * Do NOT duplicate this map in packages/ops/cli or create-sailor — those
 * re-export this module.
