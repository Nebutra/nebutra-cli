# nebutra

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [`8acefae`](https://github.com/Nebutra/Nebutra-Sailor/commit/8acefae3b5f119ce650563a78ca089c8c7fecc83) Thanks [@TsekaLuk](https://github.com/TsekaLuk)! - Align scaffolded `@nebutra/*` dependency ranges with monorepo package.json versions.
  - Make `packages/ops/preset/src/nebutra-package-versions.ts` the single source of truth
  - Re-export it from the `nebutra` and `create-sailor` CLIs (remove the stale CLI-local map)
  - Add `pnpm package-versions:sync` / `package-versions:check` and wire check into release

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Retire the scaffold-marker signing apparatus.

  The signed `.nebutra/scaffold-meta.json` marker existed for one reason: its
  presence and a valid HMAC were what conferred the Independent Developer
  License instead of AGPL copyleft. That tier was retired on 2026-07-26 and
  scaffolded projects are now MIT unconditionally, so the marker gated nothing
  and the cryptography protected nothing — while still costing a signing-key
  registry, a mirrored verifier, and a key-rotation runbook to maintain.

  Removed:
  - `nebutra license verify [path]` — the subcommand and its implementation
  - the signing-key registry and the CLI-side verifier that mirrored it
  - `POST /api/license/verify` on the marketing site, which had no callers
  - the key-rotation runbook

  `nebutra license activate <key>` and `nebutra license status` are unaffected —
  they handle paid support tiers, which still issue keys.

  The marker file itself stays, unsigned, as a provenance breadcrumb: which CLI
  version produced this project and when. It grants nothing, and deleting it
  costs a project no rights — the emitted file now says so in its own `purpose`
  field. Markers written by create-sailor <= 1.8.4 still carry `signature`,
  `nonce` and `signingKeyId`; nothing reads them any more, and their presence is
  ignored rather than rejected.

  Minor rather than patch: this removes a published CLI subcommand and a public
  HTTP endpoint.

## 0.3.8

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @nebutra/brand@0.1.2

## 0.3.7

### Patch Changes

- Stop `license verify` claiming a licence tier that no longer exists.

  The command printed "Independent Developer License valid." on success. That
  tier was retired on 2026-07-26 — commercial use is now free at any size under
  MIT (packages) and FSL-1.1-ALv2 (repository), so a scaffold marker grants
  nothing. The command now reports "Scaffold marker valid." and states that the
  marker is provenance only, with the MIT licence applying regardless of it.

  Marker verification itself is unchanged, and the legacy `independent` tier
  value is still accepted so projects scaffolded by create-sailor <= 1.8.2 keep
  verifying.

  Also adds the MIT `LICENSE` file the package declared but never shipped.

## 0.3.6

### Patch Changes

- Template / platform maintenance release:
  - Document Sailor-Template CI contract (mirror-only checks vs source monorepo).
  - Align doctor/scaffold messaging with auth-center multi-app RP topology.
  - Keep CLI compatible with Next.js `^16.2.11` platform floor.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Publish registry package metadata under the MIT license.

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @nebutra/theme@0.1.1

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`94adc0a`](https://github.com/Nebutra/Nebutra-Sailor/commit/94adc0ad7d305e92ef62411768b04f8fd79cdb48) Thanks [@TsekaLuk](https://github.com/TsekaLuk)! - Close drift between the CLI/scaffolder surface and the current monorepo.

  `nebutra`:
  - Read VERSION from package.json at module load (was hardcoded "0.1.0"
    while published as 0.3.0, breaking --version and update-notifier).
  - Switch `@nebutra/theme` dep from `workspace:*` to published `^0.1.0`
    and bundle @nebutra/\* via tsup `noExternal` so the npm package runs
    standalone (the upstream @nebutra/theme ships .ts sources Node refuses
    to import from node_modules).
  - Replace stale `api-gateway` strings with `backends/gateway` in preset
    apps, test VALID_APPS, generate route description, and ai agents
    scanner comments (file paths were already correct).
  - Clean preset app lists to actual scaffolded apps: drop `admin`, `blog`
    (don't exist as scaffolded apps; were moved into feature flags), and
    rename `docs` → `sailor-docs`.
  - Extend `nebutra doctor` with monorepo-layout drift checks: legacy
    `apps/api-gateway/` warning, presence of `backends/gateway/`,
    categorized-packages enforcement (flag flat `packages/<name>/`),
    and `.nebutra/scaffold-meta.json` marker check.
  - Add `--category <design|iam|commerce|integrations|platform|ops|ai>`
    required option to `nebutra generate package`, placing new packages
    under the categorized layout `packages/<category>/<name>/`. Also
    point `generate component` at `packages/design/ui` (was the old
    pre-merger `packages/ui`).

  `create-sailor`:
  - Show the same `NEBUTRA_TELEMETRY` first-run banner that the runtime
    CLI shows, using a shared `~/.config/nebutra/first-run-acked` marker
    so the banner only fires once per machine across both tools. Users
    running `npm create sailor@latest` now see the opt-out notice on
    first scaffold, matching what the Privacy + Cookies pages document.
